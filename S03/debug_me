The first error can be seen is that in the function that defines f(a, b, c, d), the function g(a, b) is referenced in the substraction.
For the program to work, a variable should define the result obtained from running g(a, b) before the substraction.

Secondly, if the numbers inputed in the function g are equal, a zero division error will appear at a later stage in the f function when the division of
t0 and t1 takes place. To avoid this, an if should be placed in the g function stating that the two numbers inputed into the function cannot be equal.
